TODO:

- Cancel moves between stages.
- Try anti-symmetries (works for stage 5, might work for stage 4)
- From Kociemba, do not consider solutions that contain a strict prefix that is also a solution (how in practice ?)
- From Kociemba, filter last move possibilities (is it efficient ?)
- From Kociemba, store specifically which moves decrease the distance when the distance to the subgroup is small
- Find a better way to get the edge coord of stage 4
- Doc the code !
