The five stage solver for 4x4x4 is originally a C++ program written by Bruce Norskog. Like the two-stage 3x3x3 solver made by Herbert Kociemba, this solver consists in reducing a cube position into sub-groups of lower and lower size, until the cube is solved. Some information can be found on this page: http://cubezzz.dyndns.org/drupal/?q=node/view/62 and on other posts by Bruce on the same forum.
This is an attempt to port it to java and use it as a WCA scrambler program.

Some conditions are required for this:
- it must print sufficiently short scrambles. Actual WCA scrambles are 40 twist turns long, so it should be close to this.
- it must generate solutions in a reasonable amount of time, less than a few seconds.
- it should not use too much memory, to be able to run on most computers. Also, tables should take a decent time to be generated.
